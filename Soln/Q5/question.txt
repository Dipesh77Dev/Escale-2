Q5. Creating an application to manage the interaction between 3 controllers and CRUD over
the same.
1. There will be 3 controllers, Users, Business, and Products.
User { name, email, bio, profilePic }
Business { name, email, registrationNo }
Products { name, mrp, description, image[2] }
So the purpose is to see how good you are while managing multiple collections.
You have to create the following APIs
1. Create User
2. User can have multiple businesses
3. User can post product as an individual or through his business
C - create
R - Read
U - Update
D - Delete
Functionalities for different collection
1. User - C, R
2. Business - C, R
3. Products - C, R, U, D
All the fields mentioned above shall be there, apart from this do add all the fields you feel are
important for referencing 3 collections
Indexing is required for all three collections. And make sure proper session is managed for
the logged-in user
